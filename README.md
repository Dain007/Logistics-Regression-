Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks. It is a type of regression analysis where the dependent variable is categorical and represents the outcome or class labels 
The output of logistic regression is a probability value between 0 and 1.
The logistic regression model uses the logistic function (sigmoid function) to map the linear combination of input variables to the probability of the dependent variable being in one of the two classes.
